# Card List

Repeated cards in a semantic list: a `<ul>`/`<li>` grid with consistent spacing that collapses responsively, one composed `Card` per item — the reusable component does the work, no new grid framework.

## Installation

This component requires **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. Drop `code.tsx` (or `code.jsx` for JavaScript projects) into your project. Tailwind utility classes are included directly in the component, so no separate CSS file is required.

The component consumes the DevSnips semantic design tokens through Tailwind arbitrary values (for example `bg-[var(--ds-color-surface)]`). Define the `--ds-*` tokens once in your theme — see [React/DESIGN_TOKENS.md](../../../DESIGN_TOKENS.md) for the full token spec.

## Usage

```tsx
import Card, {
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
  CardContent,
  CardFooter,
} from "./card-list";

<ul className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
  {projects.map((p) => (
    <li key={p.id}>
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>{p.name}</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>{p.desc}</CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>{p.meta}</CardContent>
        <CardFooter className="sm:justify-between">
          <p>No incidents</p>
          <button aria-label={"Open " + p.name}>Open</button>
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## JavaScript

A `code.jsx` build is provided for projects that ship plain JSX. It exposes the same API and behavior as `code.tsx` — only the TypeScript types are removed.

```jsx
import Card, {
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
  CardContent,
  CardFooter,
} from "./card-list";

<ul className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
  {projects.map((p) => (
    <li key={p.id}>
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>{p.name}</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>{p.desc}</CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>{p.meta}</CardContent>
        <CardFooter className="sm:justify-between">
          <p>No incidents</p>
          <button aria-label={"Open " + p.name}>Open</button>
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## Props

### `<Card>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the surface. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Header, content, footer, and/or media regions. |

Every attribute of a plain `<div>` (`id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, …) is forwarded. The card itself is non-interactive — use `InteractiveCard` or `SelectableCard` for click targets.

### `<CardHeader>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the header grid. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, and optionally `CardAction`. |

A `grid-cols-[1fr_auto]`: title + description stack in the text column; an optional `CardAction` sits at the top of the auto-sized action column.

### `<CardTitle>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the heading. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Title text. |

A real `<h3>` — if the page outline needs a different rank, pass the heading element semantics via your page structure (the visual style stays the same).

### `<CardDescription>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the paragraph. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Supporting description text. |

### `<CardContent>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the body region. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | The main card content. |

### `<CardFooter>`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the footer row (alignment: `sm:justify-end` / `sm:justify-between`). |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Footer actions and metadata. |

Actions stack full-width below `sm` (primary last in DOM lands on top) and lay out inline from `sm` up. No baked-in justify utility, so alignment overrides never conflict.

## Composition

- `Card` — the root surface (radius-md, 1px border, surface color, shadow-xs). A plain `<div>` that only carries structure — it adds no fake interactivity.
- `CardHeader` — the header grid: title + description in a text column, an optional `CardAction` slot at the top right.
- `CardTitle` — a real `<h3>` heading (cards are page regions, so titles are headings).
- `CardDescription` — a `<p>` of muted supporting text.
- `CardAction` — the header action slot (icon buttons, a menu trigger).
- `CardContent` — the padded body region between header and footer.
- `CardFooter` — the action row; buttons stack full-width below `sm` and lay out inline from `sm` up (same recipe as the dialog footer).
- `CardMedia` — an image framed in a crop box (`video` 16:9 / `square` 1:1 / `none` natural) with graceful fallback when `src` is omitted.
- `SelectableCard` — a native `<input type="radio">` / `type="checkbox">` whose whole card is its `<label>`; controlled and uncontrolled.
- `SelectableCardGroup` — a `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` radio group owning the single selection for single-choice card pickers.
- `InteractiveCard` — a real `<a href>` when `href` is set (navigation), otherwise a real `<button type="button">` (actions).
- `CardSkeleton` — the loading placeholder: `aria-busy` + visually hidden label, reduced-motion-safe pulse.

Compose only the primitives a card actually needs — a plain `Card` with `CardContent` and no header or footer is valid.

Structure the collection yourself (a `section` with a heading, and a `<ul>` of `<li>` items), and let each item compose the shared card primitives. Grid classes (`grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4`) live in your layout, keeping Cards free of a grid framework.

## Behavior

The demo renders four project cards from data — each a plain `Card` with header (+ a badge in the action slot when set), meta content, and a split footer. Everything repeats consistently because it maps a single composed card.

List semantics matter here: the `<ul>`/`<li>` wrapper tells assistive technology this is a collection and how many items it holds, and each item keeps its own footer action (with a unique accessible name per project).

## Keyboard Interaction

The card surface itself is not focusable and carries no keyboard behavior — that is intentional, it is not a control. Every action rendered inside it (footer buttons, header icon buttons) is a native `<button>` or `<a>`, so Tab reaches it, Enter/Space activates it, and a `focus-visible` ring marks keyboard focus.

## Accessibility

- The card is a plain structural `<div>` — no fake `role="button"`, no `tabIndex` on a container, no click handlers on `<div>` elements.
- `CardTitle` renders a real `<h3>` heading, so card titles participate in the page outline.
- Actions inside the card are real native controls with visible labels or explicit `aria-label`s and `focus-visible` rings.
- State and meaning are never carried by color alone.
- The collection is a real `<ul>` of `<li>` items inside a `section` labelled by a real `<h2>` — screen readers announce list size and position.
- Footer actions have per-item accessible names (`aria-label="Open api-gateway"`), never four buttons all named "Open".

## States

- **Surface** — `--ds-color-surface` with a 1px `--ds-color-border`, `radius-md`, and the restrained `shadow-xs` elevation (per the token rules: no floating-card aesthetics).
- **Title / description** — heading-md (18px, 600) on foreground; body-sm on `--ds-color-muted-foreground`.
- **Footer actions** — full-width stacked below `sm`, inline from `sm` up.
- **Disabled actions** — native `disabled`: 50% opacity, no pointer events, out of the tab order.

## Responsive Behavior

The grid is one column below `sm`, two columns from `sm` up, with footers aligned across equal-height tracks (`mt-auto`). The card is fluid-width (`w-full min-w-0`) and fills its container at every viewport: at 375px titles and descriptions wrap, long words break, and the header action slot shrinks to its content instead of pushing text out (the header text column is `1fr` with a `min-w-0` grid track). Footer actions stack full-width below `sm` and lay out inline from `sm` up. No horizontal overflow at 375 / 768 / 1280px.

## Styling

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and DevSnips design tokens. The component consumes the `--ds-*` semantic tokens via arbitrary values (for example `bg-[var(--ds-color-surface)]`). Define the tokens once in your theme — no component-specific CSS file is required.

## Design Tokens

See [React/DESIGN_TOKENS.md](../../../DESIGN_TOKENS.md) for the authoritative token specification. This card variant follows the token system rules: `radius-md` surfaces, 1px `color.border`, restrained `shadow-xs` elevation, heading-md titles, body-sm descriptions, and semantic status colors for trends.

## Notes

For dense text-only lists use the Table or list composition; this variant is for card content in a collection.
